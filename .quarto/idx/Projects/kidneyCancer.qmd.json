Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy reprograms a patient's immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. Whilst CAR T-cell therapy has been used sucessfully in blood cancer it has not been translated to the solid tumors. The project goal is to develop CAR-T cell therapy in kidney cancer by fine-tuning immune CAR-T cells to recognize and eliminate only cancer cells but not normal cells.\n\nWe are analyzing scRNAseq and multi omics single cell data generated as part of this project by Dr Yufei Wang and Prof Wayne Marasco in [The Marasco Laboratory](https://marascolab.dana-farber.org) in the Department of Cancer Immunology and Virology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.\n\nLearn more with this [video](https://www.vjoncology.com/video/ya9gatliajs-impact-of-the-tme-on-car-t-cell-therapy-for-kidney-cancer/)\n\n![](/contents/images/CAR-T.jpg)\"../contents/images/CAR-T.jpg\"\n\n## Publications\n\n@Wang2022\n\n## Funding Sources\n\nThis project is funded by the DoD CDMRP and methods were developed using CZI Science Seed Network funds.\n\n![DoD](../contents/logo/DOD_cdmrp_logo.jpeg){width=\"195\"} ![CZI Science](../contents/logo/CZI_science.png){width=\"164\" height=\"81\"}\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"include-after-body":["footer.html"],"output-file":"kidneyCancer.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","repo-url":"https://github.com/CompOnco","repo-actions":["edit","issue"],"twitter-card":{"creator":"@AedinCulhane","site":"@CulhaneLab"},"open-graph":true,"editor":"visual","theme":"flatly","title":"The role of immune and other cells in the tumor microenvironment in cancer","description":"We are studying the immune environment associated with response to CAR-T Cell Therapy in Kidney Cancer with the Marasco lab in Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.","about":{"template":"solana","image":"../contents/images/CAR-T.jpg","image-width":"10em"},"card_style":"summary_large_image","categories":["Genomics","scRNAseq","Single Cell","Kidney Cancer"],"bibliography":["references.bib"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
